# AdaShip
Essentially, AdaShip is a clone of the classic ‘Battleship’ game – as a default, AdaShip is a two-player, turn based game of sea warfare. You and an opponent each place a number of ships on your own board, and you then alternate turns "firing" torpedoes at each other’s ships. The game is won when one player has destroyed/sunk all of the other player’s ships.
