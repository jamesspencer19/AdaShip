# AdaShip: Assignment 2
Essentially, AdaShip is a clone of the classic ‘Battleship’ game – as a default, AdaShip is a two-player, turn based game of sea warfare. You and an opponent each place a number of ships on your own board, and you then alternate turns "firing" torpedoes at each other’s ships. The game is won when one player has destroyed/sunk all of the other player’s ships.

##Repl.it: 
To run AdaShip on Repl.it you first need to import the GitHub Repo. Then please set the run configuration to the following:  
* Select Language: `Java`
* Run Command: `mvn clean compile exec:java`

## Challenge Outline:
### Problem Summary:
I will be creating a system that replicates the game of Battleships. The system will be created in multiple releases, each adding different aspects to the game so that it eventually supports: 
* One player v computer game
* Two player game; essentially replacing the computer with a second player
* One player v computer (salvo) game
* Two player game (salvo) game
* One player v computer (hidden mines) game
* Two player game (hidden mines) game
* Computer v computer (hidden mines)

### Initial working plan, overall approach, development strategy and approach to quality:
My working plan is approach the problem by breaking down the overall problem down into smaller tasks. Each task will be organised on a Kanban board and worked on individually therefore taking an Agile approach to development. I will continuously check the quality of the code that I have written through regular code reviews with my partner, Morgan McNeil. This will help me to highlight code smells that I may not be necessarily able to see myself.

### Analysis and decomposition of the overall problem into key ‘epic’ style tasks:
My approach to creating this system will be to break down the epic, into smaller stories that can be worked on individually. I have created a Kanban board using GitHub to complete this process.

### Initial object-oriented design ideas and planned phased breakdown into smaller tasks:
I will break my system down into classes that will benefit my code re-usability, scalability and efficiency
## Development:
### Adoption and use of ‘good’ standards:
### Phase 1 development: tasks, code review and changes (repeated for each development phase.):
### Phase n development: tasks, code review and changes:
### Ensuring quality through testing and resolving bugs:
### Reflection on key design challenges, innovations and how they were solved (with examples):
## Evaluation:
### Analysis with embedded examples of key code refactoring, reuse, smells:
### Implementation and effective use of ‘advanced’ programming principles (with examples):
### Features showcase and embedded innovations (with examples) - opportunity to ‘highlight’ best bits:
### Improved algorithms – research, design, implementation, and tested confirmation (with examples):
### Reflective review, opportunities to improve and continued professional development:
